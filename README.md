# SUMMARY

rez runs C/C++ tasks.

Where other runners depend on managing secondary DSL's, *rez* collapses the software stack. Implement your build scripts in the same language as your application.

Maximize expressiveness, minimize bloat.

# DEMO

```console
$ cd examples/athena
$ rez

   ...    *    .   _  .

# ABOUT

rez allows developers to write build tasks in pure C/C++ code. This streamlines software builds. For example, common shell-outs to `rm` / `del`... become `std::filesystem::remove_all` in C++. As you migrate from shell scripts to native code, you are rewarded with faster, more reliable builds.

rez is *build tool agnostic*. rez simply wraps your traditional build tool of choice. For example, rez tasks can invoke direct compiler commands like `gcc`, or invoke an underlying build tool like `cmake`, `make`, `./configure`, `msbuild`, etc.
